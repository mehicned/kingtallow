# How to Make Beef Tallow Candles at Home Step-by-Step

Beef tallow candles are making a big comeback in 2025. People want clean-burning options without mystery chemicals, and tallow fits perfectly. It burns longer than most waxes, costs less than store-bought alternatives, and you can make them with just a few supplies.

The best part? You probably already have most of what you need if you've [rendered beef tallow at home](https://kingtallow.com/blog/how-to-render-beef-tallow-at-home-step-by-step-guide/) before. If not, that's okay too. You can buy quality tallow and still save money compared to fancy candles at boutique shops.

Candle-making sounds fancy, but it's actually simple. Heat tallow, pour it, add a wick. That's the basic version. We'll cover everything else you need to know below.

### What Makes Tallow Good for Candles

Tallow has been used for candles for centuries. Before petroleum wax became cheap, most households relied on animal fats for light. [Beef tallow in history](https://kingtallow.com/blog/beef-tallow-in-history-why-it-was-used-for-everything/) shows up everywhere from medieval churches to colonial homes.

The fat burns clean when rendered properly. Modern research confirms that properly made tallow candles produce minimal soot compared to paraffin alternatives. They also burn slower, which means each candle lasts longer.

Tallow's melting point sits around 100-118°F depending on the source fat. This makes it solid at room temperature but easy to work with when melted. [Grass-fed vs grain-fed tallow](https://kingtallow.com/blog/grass-fed-vs-grain-fed-tallow-what-s-the-difference/) can affect color slightly, but both work fine for candles.

### Supplies You'll Need

Gather these items before starting:

**Basic supplies:**
- 1-2 pounds rendered beef tallow
- Cotton candle wicks (size depends on container width)
- Heat-safe containers (mason jars, tins, or molds)
- Double boiler or makeshift version
- Wooden skewers or pencils
- Thermometer (optional but helpful)

You can use tallow you've made yourself or purchase it. [Where to buy high-quality beef tallow](https://kingtallow.com/blog/where-to-buy-high-quality-beef-tallow-online-local-options/) covers both online and local options if you need a source.

Wick size matters more than you'd think. Small containers (2-3 inches wide) need small wicks. Larger containers need thicker wicks or multiple wicks. Most craft stores label wicks by recommended container size.

#### Container Selection Tips

Mason jars work great for beginners. They handle heat well and look decent on shelves. Metal tins cool faster and travel better. Silicone molds let you pop out shaped candles easily.

Avoid thin glass or plastic containers. Tallow gets hot enough to crack cheap glass or melt plastic.

### The Basic Process

Making tallow candles follows a simple pattern. Heat the fat until liquid, prepare your containers, pour carefully, and let everything cool. The whole process takes about 30 minutes of active work, plus several hours of cooling time.

Start by checking your tallow quality. [Does beef tallow go bad?](https://kingtallow.com/blog/does-beef-tallow-go-bad-how-to-tell-if-it-s-spoiled/) explains what to look for. Fresh tallow should smell neutral or slightly beefy. Any rancid smell means don't use it.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Prep Your Workspace

Clear a flat surface near your stove. Lay down newspaper or parchment paper to catch drips. Set out all containers and wicks within easy reach.

Cut wicks to length. Each should be 2 inches taller than your container. The extra length gives you something to hold while the candle sets.

#### Step 2: Melt the Tallow

Fill the bottom pot of your double boiler with 2 inches of water. Put tallow in the top pot. Heat on medium until fully melted. This takes 10-15 minutes usually.

Stir occasionally. Tallow should be completely liquid with no chunks. If you see bits floating, keep heating and stirring.

Don't rush this with high heat. Tallow can scorch if heated too fast, which creates off smells and dark colors.

#### Step 3: Secure Your Wicks

While tallow melts, set up wicks in containers. Dip the metal tab at the bottom in melted tallow (use a spoon to get a small amount). Press it firmly to the container bottom. The tallow acts like glue.

Lay a wooden skewer or pencil across the container top. Wrap the wick around it to keep the wick centered and straight. The wick should be taut but not stretched tight.

#### Step 4: Pour the Tallow

Once tallow is fully melted, remove from heat. Let it cool for 2-3 minutes. Pouring too hot can cause cracking as the candle cools.

Pour slowly into each container. Leave about half an inch of space at the top. Tallow will sink slightly as it cools, so that gap helps.

Try to pour in one smooth motion per container. Multiple pours can create layers or air pockets.

#### Step 5: Let Everything Cool

Set containers on a flat surface away from drafts. Room temperature cooling works best. Don't put them in the fridge or freezer. Fast cooling creates cracks and sink holes.

Candles take 4-6 hours to fully harden. Larger candles need more time. You can touch the surface after an hour, but the center stays soft longer.

Once completely hard, trim wicks to about 1/4 inch above the surface. Longer wicks create bigger flames and more smoke.

### Common Problems and Fixes

Sink holes appear in the center sometimes as tallow cools. Fix this by poking holes with a skewer when the surface starts to harden. Pour a bit more melted tallow to fill gaps.

Cracks happen from cooling too fast or pouring too hot. Let tallow cool slightly before pouring next time. Keep finished candles away from cold windows or AC vents while setting.

Wicks that lean to one side didn't get secured well. The wooden skewer trick prevents this if you set it up before tallow hardens.

### Adding Scents (Optional)

Pure tallow candles have almost no smell when burning. Some people add essential oils for fragrance. Add oils after removing tallow from heat but before pouring.

Use about 1 tablespoon of essential oil per pound of tallow. Stir well to distribute evenly. Strong scents like peppermint or eucalyptus work better than subtle ones.

Some oils can affect burn quality. Test small batches before making large quantities. [How to infuse beef tallow with herbs](https://kingtallow.com/blog/how-to-infuse-beef-tallow-with-herbs-for-cooking/) covers infusion techniques that work for candles too.

### Storage and Burn Time

Store tallow candles like you'd [store beef tallow](https://kingtallow.com/blog/how-to-store-beef-tallow-shelf-life-refrigeration-freezing/) itself. Cool, dark places work best. They'll keep for months without issues.

Burn time depends on container size and wick thickness. A typical 8-ounce mason jar candle burns for 40-50 hours. That's longer than most paraffin candles of the same size.

Trim wicks before each use. This prevents smoking and keeps flames at the right height. [The Homesteading RD notes](https://thehomesteadingrd.com/tallow-candles/) that proper wick maintenance makes tallow candles burn cleaner than store-bought options.

### Cost Comparison

Making your own saves significant money. If you render tallow from [the best cuts of beef](https://kingtallow.com/blog/best-cuts-of-beef-to-use-for-rendering-tallow/), the fat is nearly free. Even buying rendered tallow costs less than $10 per pound usually.

One pound makes about four 8-ounce candles. That's roughly $2.50 per candle for materials. Fancy natural candles at stores cost $15-30 each.

Wicks and containers add minimal cost. Buy in bulk for better prices. Mason jars you already own work perfectly.

### Why Choose Tallow Over Other Waxes

Paraffin wax comes from petroleum. It's cheap but releases chemicals when burned. Soy wax sounds natural but often contains additives. Beeswax works great but costs more than tallow.

Tallow offers a middle ground. It's natural, affordable, and performs well. [Wild Foods Co explains](https://www.wildfoods.co/blogs/content/beef-tallow-candles-diy) that beef tallow candles produce a steady flame without the black smoke common in cheap paraffin candles.

The fat you'd otherwise throw away becomes useful. This appeals to people interested in using whole animals and reducing waste. [Idie's Farm points out](https://idiesfarm.com/how-to-make-natural-candles-from-beef-tallow/) that homesteaders have embraced tallow candles as part of self-sufficient living.

### Beyond Basic Candles

Once you've mastered simple poured candles, try other styles. Rolled candles use thin sheets of tallow formed around wicks. Dipped candles involve repeatedly dipping wicks in melted tallow to build up layers.

Molded candles let you create shapes. Silicone molds come in hundreds of designs. This works well for gifts or seasonal decorations.

Some people mix tallow with small amounts of beeswax for different burning properties. A 75/25 tallow-to-beeswax ratio burns slightly slower and adds a subtle honey scent.

### Getting Started Today

You don't need special skills or expensive equipment. Start with one or two candles to test the process. Use what you have around the house for containers.

The key is good quality tallow and proper wick sizing. Everything else is just details. After making your first batch, you'll see how simple it really is.

Tallow candles connect you to traditional skills while saving money. They burn clean, last long, and use materials that might otherwise go to waste.
