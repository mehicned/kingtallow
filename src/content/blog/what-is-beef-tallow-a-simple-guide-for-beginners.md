Beef tallow is showing up everywhere in 2025. Restaurants are using it for frying. Home cooks are storing jars of it in their pantries. Skincare companies are adding it to lotions. This old-fashioned cooking fat has gone from forgotten to trendy in just a few years.

But what exactly is beef tallow? At its most basic, it's rendered fat from cattle. The process of rendering transforms solid, raw fat into a smooth, shelf-stable cooking ingredient. While vegetable oils dominated kitchens for decades, many cooks are now rediscovering what their grandparents knew all along.

This guide explains everything beginners need to know about beef tallow, from how it's made to [how you can use it](/blog/top-cooking-uses-for-beef-tallow-fries-baking-high-heat-cooking/) in your own kitchen.

### The Basics of Beef Tallow

Beef tallow comes from the fat deposits found in and around cattle. Not all beef fat becomes tallow, though. The highest quality tallow comes from the fat surrounding the kidneys and along the loin. This type of fat, called suet, produces a cleaner, harder tallow with less of a meaty smell.

The rendering process matters. Raw beef fat contains water, proteins, and other tissues mixed in with the pure fat. Heating the fat slowly melts it away from these impurities. The liquid fat gets strained, cooled, and solidifies into the creamy white substance we call tallow.

You can buy tallow from butchers, specialty food stores, or online retailers. Some grocery stores stock it in the meat section. It usually comes in tubs or wrapped blocks. The color should be white or slightly off-white when solid.

#### What Makes Tallow Different from Other Fats

Tallow behaves differently than butter or vegetable oils. It stays solid at room temperature but melts easily when heated. The texture is similar to coconut oil in that regard. But tallow has a much higher smoke point, which means you can heat it to around 400 degrees Fahrenheit before it starts breaking down.

This high smoke point makes tallow excellent for high-heat cooking. Frying, searing, and roasting all work well with tallow. Olive oil and butter start smoking and degrading at much lower temperatures.

### How Tallow Is Made

The rendering process isn't complicated, but it does take time. Professional tallow makers and home cooks follow similar steps, just at different scales.

First, the raw fat gets cut into small pieces. Smaller chunks melt faster and more evenly. Some people grind the fat instead, which works fine but can make straining messier.

Next comes the actual rendering. The fat goes into a heavy pot or slow cooker with a small amount of water. Low heat is essential. Too much heat creates a burnt smell and darker color. The fat slowly melts over several hours, separating from the connective tissue and proteins. Those solid bits, called cracklings, sink to the bottom or float on top.

Once the fat is fully liquid and clear, it gets strained through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer. This removes any remaining solid bits. The pure liquid fat then cools in jars or containers. As it cools, it turns from golden liquid to solid white tallow.

#### Wet Rendering vs. Dry Rendering

Two main methods exist for rendering tallow. Wet rendering adds water to the pot along with the fat. The water helps regulate temperature and prevents burning. When the tallow cools, any remaining water separates and settles at the bottom, making it easy to remove.

Dry rendering skips the water entirely. The fat melts in its own moisture. This method works faster but requires more attention to prevent scorching. Professional operations often use dry rendering because it's more efficient at scale.

Home cooks typically prefer wet rendering. It's more forgiving and produces cleaner tallow with less effort.

### Nutritional Profile and Health Considerations

Beef tallow contains about 115 calories per tablespoon. The fat composition includes roughly 50% saturated fat, 42% monounsaturated fat, and 4% polyunsaturated fat. [These numbers matter because different fats affect health in different ways](https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/what-is-beef-tallow-is-it-good-for-me/).

Saturated fat has been controversial for years. Health authorities spent decades warning against it. Recent research has complicated that picture somewhat, though saturated fat intake should still be moderate according to most health experts.

The monounsaturated fats in tallow are the same type found in olive oil. These fats are generally considered heart-healthy. Tallow also contains small amounts of vitamins E and K, plus conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which some studies suggest may have health benefits.

One advantage tallow has over many vegetable oils is stability. Polyunsaturated fats, which make up most of oils like soybean and corn oil, break down more easily when heated. This creates oxidation and potentially harmful compounds. Tallow's higher proportion of saturated and monounsaturated fats makes it [more stable during cooking](/blog/is-beef-tallow-healthy-what-nutrition-science-says/).

### Why Cooks Choose Tallow

Several practical reasons explain tallow's comeback in kitchens:

**Flavor**: Tallow adds a rich, savory depth to food. It doesn't taste strongly of beef when properly rendered, but it does enhance the natural flavors of whatever you're cooking. French fries cooked in tallow taste different (many say better) than those cooked in vegetable oil.

**Versatility**: You can use tallow for frying, roasting, sautéing, and even baking. It works in both sweet and savory dishes, though it's more common in savory cooking.

**Cost**: Good quality tallow costs less per ounce than many specialty cooking oils. If you render your own from beef fat (which butchers often sell cheaply or give away), the cost drops even more.

**Shelf Life**: Tallow lasts much longer than most cooking fats. [Properly stored](/blog/how-to-store-beef-tallow-shelf-life-refrigeration-freezing/), it can keep for over a year without refrigeration. The low moisture content and stable fat composition prevent it from [going rancid quickly](/blog/does-beef-tallow-go-bad-how-to-tell-if-it-s-spoiled/).

**Traditional Methods**: Some cooks prefer tallow simply because it's how food was cooked for centuries. Using traditional ingredients and methods appeals to people interested in historical cooking or ancestral diets.

### Practical Uses in the Kitchen

Tallow works well for several cooking techniques. Here are the most common applications:

#### Frying and Deep Frying

Tallow excels at frying. Its high smoke point means you can get oil hot enough for a crispy exterior without burning. Fast food chains used beef tallow for fries until the 1990s, when they switched to vegetable oils. [Many chefs argue that tallow produces superior fried foods](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-beef-tallow-article).

For [deep frying at home](/blog/how-to-make-beef-tallow-french-fries-at-home/), melt the tallow in your pot or deep fryer. Heat it to 350-375 degrees Fahrenheit. The solid tallow will liquify completely as it heats.

#### Searing and Sautéing

A small amount of tallow in a hot pan creates an excellent surface for searing steaks, chops, or other proteins. The high heat tolerance means you can get a dark, flavorful crust without smoke filling your kitchen.

For sautéing vegetables, tallow adds richness that butter or olive oil can't quite match. Root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and turnips pair especially well with tallow.

#### Roasting

Roasted vegetables coated in melted tallow develop crispy edges and deep flavor. Toss cut vegetables with melted tallow, salt, and pepper, then roast at high heat (425-450 degrees). Brussels sprouts, potatoes, and cauliflower all benefit from this treatment.

#### Pie Crusts and Baking

Some bakers use tallow in pie crusts and biscuits. It creates a flaky texture similar to lard or butter. The flavor works best in savory baked goods like pot pies or hand pies with meat fillings. For sweet pies, butter usually tastes better.

Use cold, solid tallow cut into small pieces. Work it into flour just as you would butter or shortening. The key is keeping everything cold so the fat doesn't melt before baking.

### Storage and Handling

Proper storage keeps tallow fresh for months. Store it in an airtight container away from light and heat. A pantry or cupboard works fine if your kitchen doesn't get too hot. In warm climates, refrigeration extends shelf life.

Tallow doesn't need refrigeration in most cases. The low moisture and stable fat composition mean it resists spoilage. But refrigerating or freezing it does extend its life even further.

Signs that tallow has gone bad include:

- Off smell (sour or rancid)
- Gray or yellowish color instead of white
- Slimy or sticky texture
- Mold growth (rare but possible if moisture gets in)

Fresh tallow should smell clean and slightly meaty, though high-quality rendered tallow has very little smell at all.

When using tallow, scoop out what you need with a clean, dry spoon. Avoid introducing moisture or food particles into the container, as this can promote bacterial growth.

### Where to Buy Tallow

Finding beef tallow has gotten easier as it's become more popular. Several options exist:

**Local Butchers**: Many butcher shops carry rendered tallow or can order it for you. Some will sell you raw beef fat (suet) so you can render your own. This is often the cheapest option.

**Grocery Stores**: Larger grocery stores sometimes stock tallow near the meat counter or with other cooking fats. Availability varies by region.

**Online Retailers**: [Numerous online shops specialize in tallow from grass-fed cattle](/blog/where-to-buy-high-quality-beef-tallow-online-local-options/). These products often cost more but appeal to consumers concerned about how cattle were raised.

**Farmers Markets**: Vendors selling beef at farmers markets often have tallow available or can tell you where to get it locally.

**Rendering Your Own**: [Buying raw beef fat and rendering it yourself](/blog/how-to-render-beef-tallow-at-home-step-by-step-guide/) saves money. Ask your butcher for [suet or beef fat trimmings](/blog/best-cuts-of-beef-to-use-for-rendering-tallow/). Many butchers have extra fat they're happy to sell cheap.

### Common Questions About Tallow

People new to tallow often have similar concerns.

Does tallow taste like beef? Properly rendered tallow has only a subtle savory flavor. It doesn't make everything taste like pot roast. The flavor enhances food rather than overpowering it.

Is tallow healthier than vegetable oil? This depends on your definition of healthy and which vegetable oil you're comparing it to. Tallow contains more saturated fat than most vegetable oils but is more stable when heated. Moderation matters with any fat.

Can vegetarians or vegans use tallow? No. Tallow is an animal product. Plant-based alternatives include coconut oil (for high-heat cooking) or olive oil (for lower temperatures).

Will tallow clog my drains? Like any solid fat, tallow can contribute to drain clogs if poured down the sink. Let used tallow cool and solidify, then scrape it into the trash. Or strain and reuse it.

### Making Your Own Tallow

Rendering your own tallow at home is straightforward. Here's a simple process:

1. Get beef fat from a butcher (about 5 pounds makes a good batch)
2. Cut the fat into small cubes, or ask the butcher to grind it
3. Place fat in a large pot or slow cooker
4. Add about 1 cup of water
5. Heat on low for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally
6. The fat will melt and separate from solid bits
7. Strain the liquid fat through cheesecloth into clean jars
8. Let it cool completely at room temperature
9. Store in a cool, dark place

The cracklings left after straining are edible. Some people salt them and eat them as a snack. Dogs love them too (in moderation).

Grass-fed beef fat produces tallow with a slightly different nutritional profile than grain-fed beef. It typically contains more omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins. Whether this difference is significant enough to matter depends on your overall diet.

### The Environmental Angle

Tallow production uses parts of the animal that might otherwise go to waste. This whole-animal utilization appeals to people concerned about food waste and sustainability.

Compared to producing vegetable oils, which often require significant agricultural inputs like pesticides and fertilizers, tallow is essentially a byproduct of beef production. No additional land is used specifically to create it.

However, beef production itself has environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and land use. Whether tallow is more sustainable than vegetable oils depends on numerous factors, including how the cattle were raised and how the vegetable crops were grown.

### Beyond the Kitchen

Tallow has uses outside cooking. Soap makers value it for creating hard, long-lasting bars. The fat's composition produces soap with good lather and cleansing properties.

Skincare products increasingly feature tallow. Proponents claim its fat composition closely matches human skin oils, making it easily absorbed. Tallow balms and moisturizers have developed a following, though scientific research on these benefits remains limited.

[Historically, tallow fueled candles and lamps](/blog/beef-tallow-in-history-why-it-was-used-for-everything/). While modern options have replaced tallow for lighting, some people still make tallow candles as a traditional craft.

Leather workers use tallow to condition and waterproof leather goods. The fat penetrates leather fibers, keeping them supple while providing water resistance.

### Getting Started with Tallow

If you want to try cooking with tallow, start simple. Buy a small container (or render a small batch) and use it for something straightforward like roasting vegetables or frying eggs. Notice how it performs compared to your usual cooking fat.

The flavor and cooking properties take some getting used to if you've only cooked with butter or vegetable oils. But tallow's versatility and cooking performance make it worth exploring for anyone interested in traditional cooking methods or looking for alternatives to heavily processed oils.

Beef tallow isn't a miracle food or a mandatory kitchen staple. It's simply another option in your cooking fat rotation. Understanding what it is, how it works, and when to use it gives you more flexibility in the kitchen and connects you to cooking methods that sustained people for generations.
