# Amallow 100% Grass-Fed Beef Tallow Review: A Natural Skincare Option

The [Amallow 100% Grass Fed Beef Tallow for Skin Care - Face + Body - Whipped Moisturizer - Natural Lotion, 4 FL. oz. (Vanilla Lavender)](https://www.amazon.com/Amallow-100-Grass-Beef-Tallow/dp/B0CLKXXGYJ/ref=sr_1_10?crid=2NNEA8KLO60G3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vWUmpHN8IbiprR7p4dP8kpSii9vEh8XvbQ4ZjnbyPJPP6HJS92uYmwuXf4eBOGf-wKJq2lSPP6dqdQTgVsJXSe10TgEXKuW79YJDSgjd9iYWltRqXeBhHDnyA60NNPN8zUJ0QRs42UWB-CLoOcHOkaqykBkIBIC1EcrRhufuBnY4jfimVOx3xmFB6_SlJ2lGNKRHFoHPAZrgB7qnNe_o02pTSUjiygZZYbqHNhQN5SOiCcNlppFAbOGK-ceWcBkCHGqwG5GPCNwdQ2IJc7c6CERHKQ4q5AD2YpekJQ5AXeU.miH1OlOsc5tYWKFHauoYO6RrSRqCcUarX-_8zaSWvWg&dib_tag=se&keywords=beef%2Btallow&qid=1763857533&sprefix=beef%2Btall%2Caps%2C257&sr=8-10&th=1&tag=kingtallow-20) comes in a 4-ounce jar and targets people looking for simple, natural moisturizers. If you're already familiar with [beef tallow for skincare](https://kingtallow.com/blog/beef-tallow-for-skincare-how-it-works-and-why-people-use-it/), you know this ingredient has gained attention for matching the fatty acid profile of human skin. But does this specific product deliver?

Amallow uses grass-fed beef tallow as the base, which matters more than you might think. The [difference between grass-fed and grain-fed tallow](https://kingtallow.com/blog/grass-fed-vs-grain-fed-tallow-what-s-the-difference/) affects nutrient content. This version includes sweet almond oil instead of olive oil (which can clog pores for some people) and blends in vanilla and lavender essential oils.

### What's Actually Inside

The ingredient list stays short and readable. You get 100% grass-fed beef tallow first, followed by sweet almond oil and organic essential oils. No synthetic fragrances, no preservatives you can't pronounce.

This matters because tallow naturally contains vitamins A, D, E, and K. These fat-soluble vitamins absorb through your skin better than water-based formulas. Sweet almond oil adds vitamin E and doesn't block pores like heavier oils can.

The whipped texture makes it easier to apply than solid tallow balms. Some people find pure tallow too thick, especially if they want something for daily facial use.

### Texture and Application

Out of the jar, Amallow feels soft and fluffy. It's been whipped with air, so you're not getting a dense, waxy product. This makes spreading it easier, but you'll still need to work it between your hands first to warm it up.

The vanilla lavender scent is noticeable but not overwhelming. If you're sensitive to smells, this might not work for you. Amallow offers other scent options, including an unscented version through [their Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/Amallow-100-Grass-Beef-Tallow/dp/B0C3KW5VJR?tag=kingtallow-20).

Absorption takes longer than standard lotions. That's normal for tallow-based products. You're trading quick absorption for longer-lasting moisture. Give it 5-10 minutes before getting dressed or touching your phone.

### Who This Works Best For

People with dry or sensitive skin often prefer tallow because it doesn't irritate like some synthetic ingredients can. The company markets this for conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and general dryness. While individual results vary, tallow's similarity to skin's natural oils makes it worth trying if other products haven't worked.

If you have very oily skin, start small. Use it as a night cream first before committing to twice-daily application.

The 4-ounce jar might look small, but a little goes far. You only need a pea-sized amount for your whole face.

### Storage and Shelf Life

Tallow-based products need proper storage. Keep your jar in a cool, dry spot away from direct sunlight. Heat can make it separate or go rancid faster. Check out our guide on [how to store beef tallow](https://kingtallow.com/blog/how-to-store-beef-tallow-shelf-life-refrigeration-freezing/) for detailed tips.

Most tallow skincare products last 6-12 months if stored correctly. Watch for any off smells or color changes, which signal it's time to toss it. Our article on [whether beef tallow goes bad](https://kingtallow.com/blog/does-beef-tallow-go-bad-how-to-tell-if-it-s-spoiled/) covers warning signs in detail.

### Price and Value

At current pricing, Amallow sits in the mid-range for tallow skincare products. You're paying for:

* Grass-fed sourcing
* Organic essential oils
* Whipped texture (requires extra processing)
* Small-batch production

Compared to conventional moisturizers at drugstore prices, it's more expensive. But compared to high-end natural skincare brands, it's reasonable.

### Alternatives Worth Considering

Amallow offers this product in multiple scents, including [Orange Creamsicle](https://www.amazon.com/Amallow-100-Grass-Beef-Tallow/dp/B0D838BK9B?tag=kingtallow-20) and unscented options. If you want to understand what makes tallow-based skincare different from regular lotions, read [what beef tallow is](https://kingtallow.com/blog/what-is-beef-tallow-a-simple-guide-for-beginners/) and why it works for skin.

You can also [make your own tallow balms at home](https://kingtallow.com/blog/how-to-use-beef-tallow-in-homemade-soaps-and-balms/). This cuts costs significantly if you don't mind the DIY approach. You'll need to source quality tallow, which our guide on [where to buy beef tallow](https://kingtallow.com/blog/where-to-buy-high-quality-beef-tallow-online-local-options/) can help with.

### The Bottom Line

Amallow's grass-fed beef tallow moisturizer delivers what it promises. The whipped texture and added oils make it more user-friendly than plain tallow. The ingredient list stays clean and simple.

It won't replace every skincare product in your routine, but it works well as a straightforward moisturizer. The scent might be a deal-breaker for some people, while others will love it. If you're curious about tallow skincare but intimidated by making your own, this provides an easy entry point.

Just remember to store it properly and give your skin time to adjust if you're new to oil-based moisturizers.
